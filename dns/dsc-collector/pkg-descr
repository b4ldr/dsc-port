DSC collector is a binary program, named dsc, which snoops on DNS messages.
It is written in C and uses libpcap for packet capture.
dsc uses a relatively simple configuration file called dsc.conf to define certain
parameters and options. The configuration file also determines the datasets that
dsc collects.

A Dataset is a 2-D array of counters of IP/DNS message properties. You
can define each dimension of the array independently. For example you might
define a dataset categorized by DNS query type along one dimension and TLD
along the other. dsc dumps the datasets from memory to XML files every 60
seconds.
